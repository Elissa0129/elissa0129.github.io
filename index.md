I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on (hopefully!) graduating in 2027.

##  Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7
Lab 7, part 1 was a favorite because trying to figure out ways to get the code to understand the correct times and streets was definitely a puzzle. i had to figure out which operators to use and in the right order as well. But getting the test to work and try it myself was pretty impressive. 

* Lab 12
Lab 12, part 1 was the lab I most looked forward to since the beginning of this semester. Learning how to code an image that’s colorful and “moves” amazed me. I’ll be practicing over the summer trying to get different outcomes.

* Lab 3
Lab 3 part 1 was a favorite because it was the first lab I genuinely understood everything I was typing out. It gave me the confidence that I would be able to purse a career in this field. I was also fascinated with creating equations and answers based on what someone give the system.
